# CSC_505_Project_1
There are two files. The file titled VCL_run.py is for testing the code in VCL.
To run the code in VCL:
1. download the zipped data file in the same directory as the python file.
2. download the script provided into the same folder and change file permission using command: chmod +x script.sh
3. run the script as: ./script.sh
4. run the python file as: python3 VCL_run.py
5. when asked for dataset please enter a, b or c for the dataset.
6. ehen asked for the algorithm, please enter any phrase containing tim, insertion or merge to run tim_sort, inerstion sort and merge sort respectively.
7. the sorted log files will be genereated in the same folder as the python file and run times will be printed on the terminal.

If you wish to see the plots along with sorted files,
please run the tim_sort.py in an envrionment of your choosing and follow the same steps as before. This file fails in VCL beacuse of the matplotlib library, which is not available to install on VCL.
